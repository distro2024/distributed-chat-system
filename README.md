## Running the application

### System requirements 

Running this application required version `x.x.x` of node.js and version `x.x.x` of npm. 

### Installation

Start by cloning the application from the default branch (main) of the GitHub -repository with `git clone`.

The application has two modules: `director` and `node`. For each of these you need to install required dependencies. 

#### Node
Mode to the subdirectory `./node` and run the command `npm install`. To verify that everything is working correctly, run the unittests with `npm test`.

#### Director
Mode to the subdirectory `./director` and run the command `npm install`. To verify that everything is working correctly, run the unittests with `npm test`.



## Instruction for developers

### Linter
The team uses eslint for linting and it is included as a dependency. 
- It is recommended that all team members use when possible plugins for their IDEs to automatically lint the code. 
- Alternatively linting can be done with the command `npm lint`
